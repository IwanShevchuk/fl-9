        <span class="description"><article>In reality both sides of Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earch. This is because the Moon rotates around on  its own axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earch, meaning the same side is always facing the Earch. The side facing away from Earch has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft. </article></span>

        <span class="description">There ara two bulges in the Earch due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon, The bulges move around the oceans as the Earch rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.</span>

        <span class="description">The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for araund 50 billion years. By the time that happenes, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earch inside of the current 27.3 days. </span>

        <span class="title">A person would weigh much less on the Moon.</span>
        <span class="description">The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earch, due to its smaller mas, so you would weigh about one six (16.5%) of your weight on Earch. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound  so high in the air. </span>

        <span class="title">The Moon has quakes.</span>
        <span class="description">These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earch. Lunar atmosphere used seismographs on their visits to the Mon, and found that small moonquakes occured several kilometers beneath the surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a melten core , just like Earch.</span>
